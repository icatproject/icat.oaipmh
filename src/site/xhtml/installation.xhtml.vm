	<h1>Installation</h1>

	<h2>Compatibility</h2>
	This authentication plugin will work with an ICAT version of 4.9.0 or
	greater.

	<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>The icat_component distribution: <a
			href="${repoUrl}/org/icatproject/icat.component/${project.version}/icat.component-${project.version}-distro.zip">icat_component-${project.version}-distro.zip</a>
		</li>
		<li>A suitable deployed container (here assumed to be
			Glassfish/Payara) to support a web application. Testing has been
			carried out with payara41. <a
			href="http://icatproject.org/installation/glassfish/">Glassfish/Payara
				installation instructions</a> are available.
		</li>

		<li>Python (version 2.4 to 2.7) installed on the server.</li>
	</ul>


	<h2>Summary of steps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Please follow <a
			href="http://icatproject.org/installation/component/"> the
				generic installation instructions</a>
		</li>
		<li>If you are introducing the simple authenticator then update
			the run.properties file for icat.server to see the authenticator and
			restart icat to see the change. The easiest way is to rerun the setup
			script for the icat.server. <em>Remember that restful
				authenticators are identified by url rather than jndi.</em>
		</li>

		<li>Check that it works.</li>
	</ol>


	<h2>The setup.properties file</h2>
	<dl>
		<dt>container</dt>
		<dd>
			Values must be chosen from: <a target="_blank"
				href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/api/2.6/org/eclipse/persistence/config/TargetServer.html">TargetServer</a>
			Though only Glassfish is working properly at the moment.
		</dd>
		<dt>home</dt>
		<dd>is the top level of the container installation. For Glassfish
			it must contain "glassfish/domains" and for JBoss (wildfly) it must
			contain jboss-modules.jar.</dd>
		<dt>port</dt>
		<dd>is the administration port of the container which is
			typically 4848 for Glassfish and 9990 for JBoss.</dd>
		<dt>secure</dt>
		<dd>must be set to true or false. If true then only https and not
			http connections will be allowed.</dd>
	</dl>

	<h2>The logback.xml file</h2>
	<p>If you wish to modify the provided logging levels then rename
		logback.xml.example to logback.xml and edit it to suit your needs.</p>

	<h2>The run.properties file</h2>


	<dl>
		<dt>user.list</dt>
		<dd>Space separated list of user names that this plugin
			authenticates.</dd>

		<dt>user.&lt;user&gt;.password</dt>
		<dd>
			For each user given in user.list, this sets the password this user.
			This may either be a clear text password or a cryptographic hash of a
			password. <br /> A password hash must start with a &quot;$&quot;
			character and be in the same form as found in the shadow(5) password
			file. It may be created using the mkpasswd(1) utility on Debian
			systems or grub-crypt on Red Hat derived systems or the python crypt
			module. The supported hash algorithms are MD5, SHA-256, and SHA-512.
			<br /> A clear text password must not start with a &quot;$&quot;
			character.
		</dd>
		<dt>ip</dt>
		<dd>If access to the SIMPLE authentication should only be allowed
			from certain IP addresses then provide a space separated list of
			allowed values. These take the form of an IPV4 or IPV6 address
			followed by the number of bits (starting from the most significant)
			to consider.</dd>

		<dt>mechanism</dt>
		<dd>if specified is a label to appear before the user name as it
			is made available to ICAT for authorization. For example if this is
			set to 'simple' then a user with an entry of 'fred' will be provided
			to ICAT as 'simple/fred', but if no mechanism is specified it will be
			provided simply as 'fred'.</dd>
	</dl>

	<h2>Update the icat.properties file for your ICAT</h2>
	<p>This is required for icat to see the new authenticator if this
		is the first time that a RestFul (2.0.0 and greater) LDAP
		authenticator has been used by the icat.server.</p>
	<p>
		Go to the installation directory for icat.server then edit the
		run.properties to refer to the new authenticator and type:
		<kbd> ./setup install </kbd>

	</p>

	<h2>Check that icat.component works</h2>
	<p>Use testicat (which is installed with ICAT) with valid ldap
		credentials. It should report that it logs in but may or may not have
		the permission to run the rest of the test. If it does not report that
		it has logged in then please check the server.log and the
		icat_component.log files which can both be found in the logs directory.</p>

	A simple standalone test is to run:
	<blockquote>
		<code>curl -k https://localhost:8181/icat.component/description
			-w "\n"</code>
		which returns a description, <br />
		<code>curl -k https://localhost:8181/icat.component/version -w
			"\n"</code>
		which returns the version and<br />
		<code>curl -k https://localhost:8181/icat.component/authenticate
			-w "\n" -d
			'json={"credentials":[{"username":"&lt;username&gt;"},{"password":"&lt;secret&gt;"}]}'</code>
		to authenticate.
	</blockquote>
